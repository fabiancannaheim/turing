# Universal Turing Machine

This repository contains an implementation of a <b>Universal Turing Machine</b>. A Turing machine is a mathematical model 
of theoretical computer science that defines an abstract machine. A Turing machine represents an algorithm or a program. 
A calculation consists of step-by-step manipulations of symbols or characters, which are written to and read from a 
memory tape according to certain rules. Chains of these symbols can be interpreted differently, among other things as 
numbers. Thus, a Turing machine describes a function that maps strings of characters that are initially on the tape to 
strings of characters that are on the tape after "processing" by the machine. A function that can be computed using a 
Turing machine is called Turing-computable or simply computable. A <b>universal</b> Turing machine (UTM) on the other 
hand is a Turing machine that simulates any Turing machine on any input. The universal machine accomplishes this essentially 
by reading both the description of the machine to be simulated and the input to that machine from its own tape. Alan 
Turing introduced the idea of such a machine in 1936 to 1937.
